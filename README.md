# Pharmacy-Orders-Analysis

This is the analysis I did doing my internship at 1MG. 

The pharmacy orders data is evaluated on the basis of the following - 

1.Number of Orders per User

2.Frequency of orders variation with week days and day hours.

3.Frequency distribution of orders by days since prior orders.

4.Number of orders in which products are reordered.

5.Number of products in an order distribution.

6.Probability of reorder given the number of days passed since last order.

7.Products which are purchased the most.

8.Products which are most frequently bought.

9.Therapeutic class whose products are purchased the most.

10.Diseases whose related products are purchased the most.

11.Reorder Ratio variation with diseases whose related  products are purchased the most.

12.Variation of reorder ratio with week days and day hours.
